The application is a Spring Boot application, written and developed in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment and can be executed within this environment.
SDK: Java Corretto 17, Spring Boot version 3.1.4
For testing purposes, I created a local MYSQL database and used it. Integration tests are using JUnit and Mockito. The configuration files run automatically,
so for testing the program, I utilized the development environment's built-in console and pre-prepared HTTP requests.

Further Steps for Project Development:
    
1.Performance Testing

2.Security Analysis

3.Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

4.Performance Optimization

5.Thorough Testing

6.Improving Scalability
