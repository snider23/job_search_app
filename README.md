Intuitech Junior Fullstack Hazi Feladat

The application is a Spring Boot application, written and developed in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment and can be executed within this environment.
SDK: Java Corretto 17, Spring Boot version 3.1.4
I used the Reed API for getting datas for jobsearching.
For testing purposes, I created a local MYSQL database and used it. Integration tests are using JUnit and Mockito. The configuration files run automatically,
so for testing the program manually, I used Postman.

Intall:
1.Download the code
2.Checkout
3.run Maven install
4.Install MYSQL on jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/job_database?serverTimezone=UTC
    username: root
    password: test1234
5.run main Spring application (IntuitechHaziApplication)

Further Steps for Project Development:

1.Performance Testing / Performance Optimization

2.Security Analysis

3.Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

4.Thorough Testing

5.Improving Scalability
